# MIO-5271 Desktop Case

## Purpose

This project provides a desktop case for the Advantech MIO-5271 board family.
This desktop case has been developed in order to use this PC board as a small
server or a compact PC desktop with active cooling (40 mm * 10 mm fan).

The case has been developed to be 3d printed with almost all 3d printer, by
splitting the main parts in 2 smaller pieces.

## Project organization

### Main design

The project has been created using Solidworks 2014 and provide 4 parts :
    - 1 main part of the case
	- 1 cover of the box
	- 1 part to slide into the slot above the power supply socket
	- 4 feet to raise the case
	
This box has been developed to be cooled using 40mm fan or could passively 
cooled using built in slots on almost each side.

All Solidworks files are present in the Solidworks_files repo.

### 3d printing

As mentioned above, the project has been design to be 3d printed using almost
any 3d printer. For smaller 3d printer, the biggest parts has been splitted in
two parts which can be hold together by screwing the main board and the fan
inside.

All STL files are present in the STL_files repository.
